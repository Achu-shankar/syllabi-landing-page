Syllabi consists of two main components:

### Frontend (Required)
- **Next.js 15** application with App Router
- **Vercel AI SDK v5** for streaming chat responses
- **Supabase** for database and authentication
- **TailwindCSS** for styling

### Backend (Required for Document Processing)
- **FastAPI** Python service for document processing
- **Celery** for background tasks
- **Redis** for task queue
- **Required for**: Processing all documents (PDFs, videos, audio files, text extraction)
