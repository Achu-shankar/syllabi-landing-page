## Common Issues

### Chatbot Gives Wrong Answers

**Causes**:
- Outdated or incorrect documents
- Temperature too high (hallucinations)
- System prompt not specific enough

**Solutions**:
1. Review and update uploaded documents
2. Lower temperature to 0.3-0.5
3. Make system prompt more specific about using documents
4. Add explicit instructions to cite sources

### Responses Are Too Slow

**Causes**:
- Too many documents
- Large documents not chunked properly
- Model is overloaded

**Solutions**:
1. Remove unnecessary documents
2. Use smaller, focused documents
3. Switch to faster model (gpt-4o-mini)
4. Reduce max tokens in response

### Chatbot Ignores Documents

**Causes**:
- Documents not processed correctly
- Retrieval not working
- System prompt doesn't mention documents

**Solutions**:
1. Check document processing status
2. Verify embeddings were created
3. Update system prompt to explicitly use uploaded documents:
   ```
   Always search the uploaded documents before answering.
   Cite specific sections when providing information.
   ```

### Users Don't Know What to Ask

**Solutions**:
1. Add more suggested prompts
2. Add welcome message explaining capabilities
3. Provide examples in system prompt
4. Create FAQ document to upload

## Advanced Configuration

### Tool Selection Method

Control how chatbot uses tools:

**Auto (Recommended)**:
- AI decides when to use tools
- More intelligent responses
- May use multiple tools per query

**Required**:
- Always uses tools for every query
- Good for data lookup bots
- Slower but more thorough

**None**:
- Never uses tools
- Pure conversation mode
- Fastest, but no document access

### Context Window

Maximum conversation history:

```
2048 - 128000 tokens
```

- **4096**: Short conversations, fast
- **16384**: Standard conversations (default)
- **32768**: Long context, detailed discussions
- **128000**: Maximum context (Claude 3, expensive)

**Recommendation**: Start with 16384 and adjust based on needs.

### Response Settings

**Max Tokens**: Limit response length
```
256 - 4096 tokens
```
- 256: Short, concise answers
- 1024: Standard (default)
- 2048+: Detailed, long-form responses

**Stop Sequences**: End generation at specific tokens
```
["\n\nHuman:", "###"]
```
- Use to prevent chatbot from continuing conversation as user
